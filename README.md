## Allele Frequency Equation
Made by Jrws

Input the frequency of the allele of interest (a), and it will automatically give you the frequency of the other allele.
Input the fitnesses of each genotype and click calculate to get the new allele frequency after one generation.
Set the initial allele frequency to the new allele frequency to see how the frequency of the allele evolves over generations.
